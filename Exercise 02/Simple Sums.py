In this exercise, you will create and work with integer variables, perform arithmetic operations, and print the result to the console.

### Steps:
1. Declare a variable and initialize it with the integer value `8`.
2. Declare a second variable and initialize it with the integer value `10`.
3. Declare a third variable that stores the sum of first two numbers.
4. Print the value of the sum to the console.

first_value = 8
second_value = 10
Total = (first_value + second_value)
